Assumptions:
- starting w/ a 4x4 array
- can be solved simply through deduction, comparing rows, columns and squares
  - does not need to be solved by guessing a potential solution

Psuedocode
Step 1:
Level(0) = L0
- input as a string text of 16 characters
  - every 4th character will be seperated by \n

Step 2:
Rows
Level(1) = L1
- take in string and convert into an array of 4 rows seperated by "\n"
  - if the character in the string is a " ", then converting into an array with chars will change "(spaces)" to 0
  - if the character is a 0, then replace that with an object array
Level(2) = L2
- each of these rows has 4 objects. these objects can be either an array or a number
  - the object array will contain the potential solutions - [1,2,3,4]
Level(3) = L3
- compare the L-1 array with the arrays in L3
  - if the nums in L3 contain L-2 nums, delete those nums in L3
  - if the array in L3 contains only a single element, flatten L3
  - if the array in L2 contains only a single element, flatten L2

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 for rows 2-4

Step 4:
Columns
Level(1) =L1
- create an object that coverts column (row[0]) into an array
  - if the character is a 0, then replace that with an object array
Level(2) = L2
- each of these rows has 4 objects. these objects can be either an array or a number
  - the object array will contain the potential solutions - [1,2,3,4]
Level(3) = L3
- compare the L1 array with the arrays in L3
  - if the nums in L3 contain L2 nums, delete those nums in L3
  - if the array in L3 contains only a single element, flatten L3
  - if the array in L2 contains only a single element, flatten L2

Step 5: Repeat step 4 for columns 2-4

step 6:
Squares
Level(1) =L1
- create an object that coverts column (row1[0,2] and row2[0,2]) into an array
  - if the character is a 0, then replace that with an object array
Level(2) = L2
- each of these rows has 4 objects. these objects can be either an array or a number
  - the object array will contain the potential solutions - [1,2,3,4]
Level(3) = L3
- compare the L1 array with the arrays in L3
  - if the nums in L3 contain L2 nums, delete those nums in L3
  - if the array in L3 contains only a single element, flatten L3
  - if the array in L2 contains only a single element, flatten L2

Step 7: Repeat step 6 for squares 2-4

Step 8: Repeat steps 2-7 until solved

Step 9: If it is still not solved, it's likely your 2nd assumption is not true
